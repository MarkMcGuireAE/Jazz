I developed this Craps Game with no tutorial and having not even looked at a similar example online (which i regret doing). With slight help from my instructors, I was able to put together a fully functioning, simplified vanilla javascript version of casino craps and I had a great time doing so as well.",

This is a website for a local youth basketball program that my son is a part of. This is a project that will have real world application and will be used daily. This is a full stack MERN app, giving you the ability to register a user, login, logout, and capture form data for later use.",
